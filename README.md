# Authentic Path — Site Export

This ZIP includes two redesigned homepages:

- `index.html` — Light, classic, family‑friendly design with interactive metrics and Program Finder.
- `index_alt.html` — Risk‑forward dark theme with trend‑driven bento layout and progress bar.

Also included:
- `thanks.html` — Redirect target used by the contact form (`_redirect`).
- `assets/logo.png` — Placeholder logo (replace with your real logo path).
- `og-image.png` — Placeholder social share image (replace as desired).

## How to Use
1. Pick a version:
   - Use `index.html` **or** rename `index_alt.html` → `index.html`.
2. Replace the placeholder logo at `assets/logo.png` with your logo file (keep the same filename or update the `<img src>` paths).
3. Update the contact form endpoint if needed (`action="https://formspree.io/f/mqaypayl"`).
4. (Optional) Enable GA4 by pasting your Measurement ID where indicated.
5. Deploy via GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or your host of choice.
